This repo is a project started with personal curiosity and passion. My goal is to develop a page builder similar to WordPress' popular [Elementor plugin](https://elementor.com/). One of the most important aspects of the project, together with the created pages, is that the page builder is designed to run on Next.js, so that the created website can be easily built and published.

## Goals and Expectations

Our project aims to develop an interface that will enable users to easily create and edit their pages. We appreciate Elementor's unique features and functionality and are inspired by these features to develop a unique page builder.

Moreover, we aim to ensure that this page builder integrates seamlessly with Next.js. This means that the created pages can be built with Next.js and published quickly and effectively. This integration will increase the flexibility and usability of the page builder and better serve the needs of the users.

We welcome all kinds of feedback and contributions during the progress and development of this project. If you want, you can send a pull request to the repo, or share your questions, suggestions and ideas in the Issues section.
